# Bund App

## Description


A project in which there are two pages and many buttons. This application describes investment. This application comes with an interface design. The first screen is the main screen. Then there is a bar at the bottom to navigate between the pages. Then the next page is investment. Here there is an investment calculation based on an equation and a fixed value based on which we calculate.

## Challenges and Design Decisions

Challenges:
Design Integration Across Devices:

The main challenge was to ensure seamless design integration across different devices and ensure a responsive user experience.
Managing changing situations:

Handling different situations such as large and small screen situations, ensuring dynamic UI updates.
Dimensional flexibility:

Avoid inappropriately fixed dimensions and work to specify dimensions using relative units.


We've used responsive images that adapt to different screen resolutions to improve image quality.
Clear documentation:

We've documented all challenges and design decisions in a README file to help other developers understand and customize the project.
